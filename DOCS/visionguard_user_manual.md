- Verify internet connectivity for initial setup

**Choose Installation Location:**
- Find a spot on your TV bezel where the sensor has a clear view of the seating area
- Ensure the location allows easy access to the USB-C port for power
- Avoid locations that might obstruct TV ventilation

### System Requirements

**WiFi Network:**
- 2.4GHz WiFi (802.11b/g/n/ax)
- WPA2 or WPA3 security (recommended)
- Internet connection for initial setup and updates

**Power Requirements:**
- USB-C connection
- Standard phone charger or TV USB port

**Compatible Devices for Configuration:**
- Smartphone, tablet, or computer with web browser
- Modern browsers: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Choose Mounting Location

**Optimal Placement:**
- **Top center** of TV bezel (most common and effective)
- **Side edges** if top mounting isn't possible
- **Bottom center** as last resort (may have viewing angle limitations)

**Mounting Requirements:**
- Clear line of sight to seating area
- At least 5cm clearance from TV vents
- Accessible for USB-C cable connection
- Stable surface that won't flex

### Step 2: Prepare the Surface

**For Adhesive Mounting:**
1. Clean the mounting area with isopropyl alcohol
2. Allow surface to dry completely (5-10 minutes)
3. Ensure surface temperature is between 15-40¬∞C (59-104¬∞F)

**For Magnetic Mounting:**
1. Verify TV bezel is magnetic (test with included magnet)
2. Clean the area with a dry cloth
3. Remove any protective films or stickers

### Step 3: Mount the Device

**Adhesive Installation:**
1. Remove backing from adhesive strip
2. Position VisionGuard with sensor facing the seating area
3. Press firmly for 30 seconds
4. Wait 24 hours before handling for maximum adhesion

**Important:** The sensor (round window) must face toward the seating area, not the TV screen.

### Step 4: Connect Power

**USB-C Connection:**
1. Connect the provided USB-C cable to VisionGuard
2. Connect the other end to:
   - **TV USB port** (if available and powered when TV is on)
   - **Wall adapter** using a certified 5V charger
   - **Power strip** with USB charging ports

**Cable Management:**
1. Use provided cable clips to secure cable along TV bezel
2. Route cable to avoid interference with TV controls
3. Ensure cable doesn't create tension on the VisionGuard device

### Step 5: Verify Installation

**Power Verification:**
- Connect power and verify LED illumination
- Blue LED indicates setup mode
- Green LED indicates normal operation
